# Dark Bliss Reloaded
A VS Code color theme inspired by the [Dark Bliss](https://studiostyl.es/schemes/dark-bliss) Visual Studio theme.

There are some differences in highlighting. My motivation was to reuse the color palette and not the full replication of the Visual Studio version.

The following languages were in focus while the initial development:

- C#
- Html
- TypeScript
- Sass
